## 🎯 How It Works

### 1. **Two-Tier Color Detection System**
**Tier 1 - Smart OCR-based Detection (Preferred):**
- Performs OCR on all cells to find position text and player names
- Collects HSV color samples from cells containing recognized positions
- Calculates color ranges using percentiles and padding
- High confidence (1.0) when ≥3 positions detected

**Tier 2 - K-means Clustering Fallback:**
- Applies K-means clustering with 6 clusters to entire image
- Filters pixels by saturation/value to remove background
- Assigns clusters to positions: WR→RB→QB→TE→DST→K
- Lower confidence (0.5) fallback method

### 2. **Dual OCR Strategy with Competition**
**ROI-Based Approach:**
- Divides each cell into 5 targeted regions based on research of common draft card formats
- **Last Name** (center): Prioritized as most consistently placed, formatted, and readable
- **Position** (top-left), **Bye** (top-right), **Team** (bottom-left), **First Name** (bottom-right)
- Individual preprocessing and OCR for each region with PSM=7
- Position-specific whitelists optimize for expected content

**Whole-Cell Approach:**
- Designed for **generalizability** across diverse card formats and styles
- Processes entire cell as single unit with PSM=6
- Intelligent parsing using regex and stopword filtering  
- **Name Swapping Logic**: Tests first/last name arrangements automatically
- Ensures system works with any card format, not just common layouts

**Competition System:** Both approaches compete, highest match score wins

### 3. **Advanced Player Prediction with 7-Component Scoring**
- **Last Name (40 pts)**: Fuzzy string matching with token_set_ratio
- **First Name (15 pts)**: Additional fuzzy validation when available
- **Team Match (15 pts)**: Exact team abbreviation matching
- **Bye Week (10 pts)**: Exact bye week number validation
- **Color Position (15 pts)**: Position from color analysis
- **OCR Position (10 pts)**: Position from text recognition
- **Draft Likelihood (20 pts)**: Gaussian probability model using ADP rankings

### 4. **Exact Match Override System**
**Player Stealing Logic:**
- Perfect last name matches can override lower-confidence assignments
- ✅ **Can steal**: Players assigned via standard (fuzzy) matching
- ❌ **Cannot steal**: Players assigned via exact matching (locked)
- Displaced cells get full re-reconciliation without stolen player

### 5. **Draft Position Intelligence**
- **Snake Draft Logic**: Converts grid position to draft pick number
- **Variable Sigma Model**: σ = 2.0 + 0.1 × player_rank (uncertainty grows with rank)
- **ADP Integration**: Uses Average Draft Position for realistic predictions
- **Context Awareness**: Early picks more predictable than late picks

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd draftboard_ocr
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## 🎮 Usage

### Web Interface (Recommended)

**Option 1: Direct launch (no auto-browser)**
```bash
python3 app.py
```

**Option 2: Startup script (auto-opens browser)**
```bash
python3 start_web.py

2. Open your browser automatically (start_web.py only)
3. Provide an interactive interface for:
   - **Image Upload & Cropping**: Upload and crop draft board images
   - **Two-Tier Color Calibration**: Manual color picking or automatic detection
   - **Real-Time Processing**: Dual OCR strategy with live competition results
   - **Interactive Results**: Grid view, team rosters, and statistical analysis
   - **Manual Corrections**: Click any cell to edit player assignments
   - **Multiple Export Formats**: CSV, JSON, visual overlays, and team rosters
   - **ESPN Fantasy Integration**: Automated league population via Selenium

### Command Line Interface
```bash
python3 run_full_board.py
```

This will:
1. **Board-Level Preprocessing**: CLAHE enhancement and bilateral filtering
2. **Grid Extraction**: Precise cell boundary calculation (16×10 default)
3. **Dual OCR Competition**: ROI-based vs whole-cell approaches compete
4. **Advanced Player Prediction**: 7-component scoring with exact match override
5. **Multi-Format Output**: Generate comprehensive results in `full_board_out/`

### Output Files

**CLI Output** (`full_board_out/` directory):
- **`board.csv`**: Complete data in CSV format
- **`rows.txt`**: Row-major draft format
- **`cols.txt`**: Column-major format

### Color Calibration
The web interface provides two color calibration methods:

**Manual Color Selection:**
1. **Upload and crop** your draft board image
2. **Click "Pick Color"** for each position (QB, RB, WR, TE, K, DST)
3. **Click directly on colored stickers** in your image
4. **System samples exact RGB/HSV** from clicked pixels
5. **Proceed to processing** once all 6 positions are selected

**Automatic Color Detection:**
1. **Click "Detect Colors Automatically"** button
2. **Tier 1**: System performs OCR on all cells to find position text
3. **Collects HSV samples** from cells with recognized positions
4. **If ≥3 positions detected**: Uses statistical analysis (high confidence)
5. **If <3 positions detected**: Falls back to K-means clustering (lower confidence)
6. **Refine manually** if needed, or proceed to processing

## 🎨 Advanced Color Detection System

### Two-Tier Intelligence
**Tier 1 - Smart OCR-based Detection:**
- Performs OCR on all cells to identify position text and player names
- Collects HSV samples from cells containing recognized positions (QB, RB, etc.)
- Calculates statistical color ranges using percentiles with intelligent padding
- Achieves high confidence (1.0) when ≥3 positions successfully detected

**Tier 2 - K-means Clustering Fallback:**
