## 🎯 How It Works

### 1. **Color Profile Configuration**
**Why Color Detection is Critical:**
Draft board stickers often have inconsistent formatting, poor photo quality, and hard-to-read text. The system uses **color as a primary predictor** to reliably identify player positions, ensuring generalizability across diverse sticker formats. By knowing the position with high certainty from color analysis, the system can effectively guide OCR and prediction processes for the remaining sticker content.

**Configuration Methods:**
The system requires color profiles for each position (QB, RB, WR, TE, K, DST) and can be configured through:

**Manual Color Selection (Primary Method):**
- User clicks directly on colored stickers in the web interface
- System captures exact HSV values from selected pixels
- Provides precise control over color ranges

**Automatic Detection (Alternative Method):**
- **Tier 1**: OCR-based detection finds position text and samples colors
- **Tier 2**: K-means clustering fallback when insufficient positions detected
- Assigns clusters to positions: WR→RB→QB→TE→DST→K
- Lower confidence (0.5) fallback method

### 2. **Dual OCR Strategy with Competition**
With position reliably identified through color analysis, the system can focus OCR efforts on extracting player names from often poor-quality sticker text:

**ROI-Based Approach:**
- Divides each cell into 5 targeted regions based on research of common draft card formats
- **Last Name** (center): Prioritized as most consistently placed, formatted, and readable
- **Position** (top-left), **Bye** (top-right), **Team** (bottom-left), **First Name** (bottom-right)
- Individual preprocessing and OCR for each region with PSM=7
- Position-specific whitelists optimize for expected content

**Whole-Cell Approach:**
- Designed for **generalizability** across diverse card formats and styles
- Processes entire cell as single unit with PSM=6
- Intelligent parsing using regex and stopword filtering  
- **Name Swapping Logic**: Tests first/last name arrangements automatically
- Ensures system works with any card format, not just common layouts

**Competition System:** Both approaches compete, highest match score wins

### 3. **Smart Player Prediction Workflow**
**The Foundation: 500-Player Database**
The system starts with a comprehensive database of the top 500 fantasy football players, ranked by Average Draft Position (ADP) and containing all relevant draft information (name, team, position, bye week).

**Step-by-Step Filtering Process:**
1. **Position-Based Filtering (67-94% reduction)**: Uses color-detected position to filter the 500-player pool down to only candidates of the correct position (e.g., ~32-172 players depending on position)
2. **Exclude Already Drafted**: Removes players already assigned to other cells
3. **Multi-Factor Scoring**: Applies 7-component scoring system to remaining candidates:
   - **Last Name (40 pts)**: Fuzzy string matching with token_set_ratio
   - **First Name (15 pts)**: Additional fuzzy validation when available
   - **Team Match (15 pts)**: Exact team abbreviation matching
   - **Bye Week (10 pts)**: Exact bye week number validation
   - **Color Position (15 pts)**: Confirmation that detected position matches database
   - **OCR Position (10 pts)**: Position from text recognition
   - **Draft Likelihood (20 pts)**: Gaussian probability model using ADP rankings
4. **Best Match Selection**: Highest-scoring available player wins

### 4. **Exact Match Override System**
**Player Stealing Logic:**
When a cell contains a perfect OCR match for a player's last name, the system can "steal" that player from a previous fuzzy assignment:
- ✅ **Can steal**: Players assigned via standard fuzzy matching (lower confidence)
- ❌ **Cannot steal**: Players assigned via exact matching (locked)
- **Re-reconciliation**: Displaced cells get completely re-processed without the stolen player
- **Override Priority**: Exact matches take precedence even if the player was already "drafted"

### 5. **Draft Position Intelligence**
- **Snake Draft Logic**: Converts grid position to draft pick number
- **Variable Sigma Model**: σ = 2.0 + 0.1 × player_rank (uncertainty grows with rank)
- **ADP Integration**: Uses Average Draft Position for realistic predictions
- **Context Awareness**: Early picks more predictable than late picks

2. Open your browser automatically (start_web.py only)
3. Provide an interactive interface for:
   - **Image Upload & Cropping**: Upload and crop draft board images
   - **Two-Tier Color Calibration**: Manual color picking or automatic detection
   - **Real-Time Processing**: Dual OCR strategy with live competition results
   - **Interactive Results**: Grid view, team rosters, and statistical analysis
   - **Manual Corrections**: Click any cell to edit player assignments
   - **Multiple Export Formats**: CSV, JSON, visual overlays, and team rosters
   - **ESPN Fantasy Integration**: Automated league population via Selenium

### Command Line Interface
```bash
python3 run_full_board.py
```

This will:
1. **Board-Level Preprocessing**: CLAHE enhancement and bilateral filtering
2. **Grid Extraction**: Precise cell boundary calculation (16×10 default)
3. **Dual OCR Competition**: ROI-based vs whole-cell approaches compete
4. **Advanced Player Prediction**: 7-component scoring with exact match override

### Color Calibration
**Critical Foundation:** Color-based position detection is essential because draft board stickers often have inconsistent text formatting and poor photo quality. By establishing reliable color profiles, the system can confidently identify each player's position, dramatically reducing the search space (67-94% fewer candidates) and enabling accurate player predictions even with hard-to-read sticker text.

The web interface provides two color calibration methods:

**Manual Color Selection:**
1. **Upload and crop** your draft board image
2. **Click "Pick Color"** for each position (QB, RB, WR, TE, K, DST)
3. **Click directly on colored stickers** in your image
4. **System samples exact RGB/HSV** from clicked pixels
5. **Proceed to processing** once all 6 positions are selected

**Automatic Color Detection:**
1. **Click "Detect Colors Automatically"** button
2. **Tier 1**: System performs OCR on all cells to find position text
3. **Collects HSV samples** from cells with recognized positions
4. **If ≥3 positions detected**: Uses statistical analysis (high confidence)
5. **If <3 positions detected**: Falls back to K-means clustering (lower confidence)
6. **Refine manually** if needed, or proceed to processing

- **Manual Calibration**: 5th-95th percentiles with proportional padding

## 🎨 Advanced Color Detection System

### Two-Tier Intelligence
**Tier 1 - Smart OCR-based Detection:**
- Performs OCR on all cells to identify position text and player names
- Collects HSV samples from cells containing recognized positions (QB, RB, etc.)
- Calculates statistical color ranges using percentiles with intelligent padding
- Achieves high confidence (1.0) when ≥3 positions successfully detected

**Tier 2 - K-means Clustering Fallback:**
- Applied when Tier 1 fails to detect sufficient positions
- Filters pixels by saturation/value thresholds to remove background
- Performs 6-cluster K-means on entire image
- Assigns clusters to positions by size: WR→RB→QB→TE→DST→K
- Lower confidence (0.5) but ensures system always works

### Web-Based Color Calibration
- **Direct Pixel Sampling**: Click-to-select exact colors from your image
- **Position-Specific Tolerances**: Tailored HSV ranges for each position type
- **OCR-Based Auto-Detection**: Intelligent sampling from recognized position text
