## Final Architecture

### Core System Components

1. **Board-Level Preprocessing** (`src/preprocess.py`)
   - CLAHE contrast enhancement on HSV V-channel (clipLimit=2.0, tileSize=8x8)
   - Bilateral filter denoising (d=9, sigmaColor=75, sigmaSpace=75)
   - Precise image enhancement without perspective correction
   - Optimized for already-cropped draft board images

2. **Precision Grid Extraction** (`src/grid.py`)
   - Integer-boundary cell extraction with no gaps or overlaps
   - Configurable grid dimensions (default: 16√ó10 for 160 cells)
   - Exact pixel coverage using rounded boundaries
   - Cell coordinate and dimension generation

3. **Dual OCR Competition System** (`src/ocr_cell.py`)
   - **ROI-Based Approach**: 5 targeted regions based on research of common draft card formats
     - Last Name (center): Prioritized as most consistently placed, formatted, and readable
     - Position, Bye, Team, First Name regions optimized for typical card layouts
   - **Whole-Cell Approach**: Designed for generalizability across diverse card formats
     - Single preprocessing with intelligent token parsing for any card style

   - **Competition System**: Both approaches compete, highest score wins
   - Advanced neutral_otsu preprocessing pipeline for optimal OCR

4. **Advanced Player Prediction** (`src/reconcile.py`)
   - **7-Component Scoring System**: 125-point maximum with weighted factors
   - **Exact Match Override**: Perfect name matches can steal players from fuzzy assignments
   - **Player Stealing Logic**: Intelligent reassignment with locked exact matches
   - **Draft Likelihood Model**: Gaussian probability using ADP rankings (œÉ = 2.0 + 0.1 √ó rank)
   - **Sophisticated Duplicate Prevention**: Composite identity tracking

5. **Comprehensive Output Generation** (`src/emit.py`)
   - Multiple formats: CSV, JSON, row/column text, visual overlays
   - Low-confidence review files with detailed flagging
   - Team roster organization for fantasy league management
   - Color-coded visual overlays with match confidence indicators

6. **Two-Tier Color Detection** (`src/manual_color_calibration.py`)
   - **Tier 1**: Smart OCR-based detection with statistical analysis
   - **Tier 2**: K-means clustering fallback with 6-cluster assignment
   - K-means visualization plots for color spectrum analysis
   - Statistical HSV range calculation with proportional padding

7. **ESPN Fantasy Integration** (`src/espn_uploader.py`)
   - Selenium WebDriver automation for ESPN Fantasy Football
   - Dry-run mode for safe preview and validation
   - Automated login, navigation, and team roster population
   - Comprehensive error handling and logging

8. **Interactive Web Interface** (`app.py`, `templates/`, `static/`)
   - Real-time processing with dual OCR competition display
   - Interactive cell editing with immediate result updates
   - Multiple view modes: grid, team rosters, statistical analysis
   - ESPN upload integration with credential management

## Revolutionary Innovations

### 1. Two-Tier Color Detection Intelligence
- **Tier 1 - Smart OCR Detection**: Uses actual draft board content to identify colors
  - Performs OCR on all cells to find position text and player names
  - Collects HSV samples from cells containing recognized positions
  - Statistical analysis using 5th-95th percentiles with intelligent padding
  - High confidence (1.0) when ‚â•3 positions detected
- **Tier 2 - K-means Fallback**: Ensures system always works
  - 6-cluster K-means on filtered pixels (removes background/white)
  - Assigns clusters by size: WR‚ÜíRB‚ÜíQB‚ÜíTE‚ÜíDST‚ÜíK
  - Lower confidence (0.5) but 100% fallback coverage

### 2. Dual OCR Competition System
- **ROI-Based Approach**: Research-driven targeted regions for common draft card formats
  - **Last Name (center)**: Prioritized as most consistently placed, formatted, and readable
  - Position (top-left), Bye (top-right), Team (bottom-left), First Name (bottom-right)
  - Individual neutral_otsu preprocessing per region
  - PSM=7 with targeted whitelists ('QBWRTEDSTK', 'BYE 0123456789')
- **Whole-Cell Approach**: Generalizability-focused full-cell processing
  - Designed to handle diverse card formats and styles beyond common layouts
  - Single neutral_otsu preprocessing on entire cell
  - PSM=6 with token confidence scoring and intelligent parsing
  - **Name Swapping Logic**: Automatically tests first/last arrangements
- **Competition**: Both approaches compete, highest match score wins (ROI preferred on ties)

### 3. Advanced Player Prediction with Exact Match Override
- **7-Component Scoring System** (125 points maximum):
  - Last Name (40 pts): Fuzzy string matching with token_set_ratio
  - First Name (15 pts): Additional validation when available
  - Team Match (15 pts): Exact team abbreviation matching
  - Bye Week (10 pts): Exact bye week validation
  - Color Position (15 pts): Position from color analysis
  - OCR Position (10 pts): Position from text recognition
  - Draft Likelihood (20 pts): Gaussian model using ADP rankings
- **Exact Match Override System**: Revolutionary player stealing logic
  - Perfect name matches can override fuzzy assignments elsewhere
  - ‚úÖ Can steal: Players assigned via standard (fuzzy) matching
  - ‚ùå Cannot steal: Players assigned via exact matching (locked)
  - Displaced cells get full re-reconciliation without stolen player

### 4. Draft Position Intelligence with ADP Integration
- **Snake Draft Logic**: Converts grid position to draft pick using snake pattern
- **Variable Sigma Model**: œÉ = 2.0 + 0.1 √ó player_rank (uncertainty grows with rank)
- **ADP Rankings**: Uses Average Draft Position for realistic probability modeling
- **Context Awareness**: Early picks more predictable than late picks

### 5. ESPN Fantasy Automation
- **Selenium WebDriver**: Automated browser control for ESPN Fantasy Football
